Normalization is a process in database design used to:

Avoid Redundancy: It ensures that data is not duplicated across the database.
This means storing each piece of information in one place only.

Prevent Anomalies:
Insert Anomaly: Prevents issues when inserting new data if certain information cannot be added 
without other related data being present.
Update Anomaly: Prevents problems when updating data, ensuring that changes are consistently 
applied across the database.
Delete Anomaly: Avoids issues when deleting data, ensuring that removal of information does
not unintentionally remove related data.
In summary: Normalization helps to organize data into separate tables based on logical relationships,
reducing redundancy and preventing inconsistencies that can occur during insert, update, or delete operations.
